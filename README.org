* NeuralNet Exo

This git repo is just my first step to understand and practice the basics of Machine Learning and Neural Network.
I used python for obvious reason. This first test is not meant to be efficient and I don't plan to create a better module.

As a reference, I used /Neuronale Netze und Matrix Produkt Zust√§nde/ by /David Maier/
